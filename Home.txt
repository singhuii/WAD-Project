				Welcome to my first website!
			</p>

			<p>
				I am Sing Hui, a Year 3 Civil Engineering Student studying in NUS. I am actively involved in 
        various CCAs in my hostel, and I am especially passionate about playing sports and keeping fit. I aspire to become a competent and innovative Civil Engineer, and to have a fulfilling career in building useful infrastructures for the world.

				The reason why I decided to join Smartcademy's Web App Devleopment Class is to expand my knowledge on programming.
